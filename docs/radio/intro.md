# Introduction
SYNQ Radio AI...

## How It Empowers Retail
Most stores have a communication gap â€” mobile compute can't connect to radios and radios can't interact with customers. This fragmentation negatively impacts efficiency and customer experience. 

## How It Works
You connect one of your in-store radios to the SYNQ Radio Edge Compute using our adapter. Now everything that radio receives gets captured, logged, and analyzed. SYNQ Radio can also broadcast voice messages to your staff using that radio.

Any event observed by SYNQ modules, like a call button press or curbside pickup arrival, can be announced over the radio, and claimed by staff on radios using voice commands. 

Enable AI agents and your staff can interact with those agents directly over the radio using natural language. They can look up product inventory and store information, or ask an agent to perform any task that agent understands. 

## Requirements
What you need to get up and running with SYNQ Radio AI:
- SYNQ Radio Edge Compute
  - Power (120V)
  - Ethernet connectivity
- SYNQ Radio Hardware Adapter
- Donor Radio (see [Supported Radio Models](#supported-radio-models))
  - Power for donor radio (typically via a docking charger)

## Supported Radio Models
Our growing list of tested and supported radio models:
- ICOM IC-M37
- Motorola CLP1043
- Motorola DLR1020

We can accommodate additional radio models so long as the model supports some form of external headset jack. Get in touch with us at contact@synqtech.com and let us know what radio models you use.
