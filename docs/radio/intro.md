# Introduction
SYNQ Radio AI...

## How It Empowers Retail
Most stores have a communication gap â€” mobile compute can't connect to radios and radios can't interact with customers. This fragmentation negatively impacts efficiency and customer experience. 

## Requirements
What you need to get up and running with SYNQ Radio AI:
- SYNQ Radio Edge Compute
  - Power (120V)
  - Ethernet connectivity
- SYNQ Radio Hardware Adapter
- Donor Radio (see [Supported Radio Models](#supported-radio-models))
  - Power for donor radio (typically via a docking charger)

## Supported Radio Models
Our growing list of tested and supported radio models:
- ICOM IC-M37
- Motorola CLP1043
- Motorola DLR1020

We can accommodate additional radio models so long as the model supports some form of external headset jack. Get in touch with us at contact@synqtech.com and let us know what radio models you use.
