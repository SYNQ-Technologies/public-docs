## Pre-Installation Checklist

### Donor Radios
1. Confirm the location uses a SYNQ [supported radio model](./intro.md#supported-radio-models).
2. You will need two radios complete do the installation.
   - **Radio #1** is the "donor" radio that remains permanently docked/connected inside the radio kit.
   - **Radio #2** is for testing the system and can be returned when installation completes.
3. Verify that the radios are on the channel, frequency, and privacy code used at this location.
4. Disable the "Roger Beep" feature on the **Radio #1** (if applicable).

:::important
The donor radio needs to be in good working condition.

### Location
It is important to select a suitable install location for the radio kit.
1. Test that radios operate normally with good reception and transmission from this location.
2. Does the location have Ethernet accessible?
3. Does the location have 110V power?
4. Does the location have a wall to mount the radio kit to, or a shelf that it can sit on?
5. Is the location secure so that the kit will not be tampered with?

:::important
The install location needs to be in an area with good radio reception. Do not sacrifice radio reception quality, for ease of installation.
:::

### Network
When the device is plugged into Ethernet will it be able to reach the internet? Or are there special networking requirements that must be satisfied?
- Does the device need to be pre-assigned to a specific VLAN?
  - We can provide the MAC Address and host name of the device.
- If your network uses a security appliance that requires devices to use a specific Root CA certificate, contact us to ensure the device is pre-provisioned with the necessary certificates.
