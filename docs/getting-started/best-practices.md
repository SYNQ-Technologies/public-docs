# Best Practices

## Identity
### Best-Case Scenario: Unique Identity for All Staff
Implementing a unique identifier/identity for all staff and enforcing a disciplined sign-in/out
process offers significant benefits. While this can be challenging, the advantages in terms
of data accuracy, staff accountability, and performance management far outweigh the
complexities of the process.
### Hybrid Approach: Mixed Device Ownership
Recognizing that a unique identifier for all staff may not always be feasible, a hybrid
approach is an alternative option. In this scenario, certain staff members should have their
own devices.
These typically include:
- Management/Supervisory/Senior staff
- Online order pickers
- BDR
- Administrative staff (e.g., those handling price changes, relines, etc.)
For these staff members, the process remains largely unchanged. The key addition is the
disciplined sign-on to Microsoft Teams, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and
accountability.

### Zone Defense: Shared Sign-In
For operations requiring shared devices, a zone defense approach can be effective. Shared
devices can be used for segmented operations such as:
- Curbside pickup
- General help desks
- Customer inquiries regarding the status of requests
- Escalation management (acting as a safety net)
- Bespoke picking tasks
- High traffic areas
- Handling abnormal request flows
- Managing absenteeism

### Worst-Case Scenario: Generic Sign-Ins
In situations where individualized sign-ins are not possible, using generic sign-ins for all
staff can alleviate initial sign-in challenges and get operations started. However, this
approach negatively impacts data accuracy, accountability, and limits the potential for
advanced analytics.

## Messaging Channels Setup
When organizing teams within Microsoft Teams or your messaging platform, consider factors such as department
structure, store geography, and leadership hierarchy.

#### Examples
Geography-Based Setup: If produce is located near BDR in your store layout, create
linkages for escalation flow, enabling the produce senior team to assist with BDR requests
that exceed the Service Level Expectation (SLE).

Skill-Based Setup: Organize escalation management based on specific skill sets,
regardless of department or geography (e.g., food safety, forklift operations).

Cultural Alignment: Consider cultural tools that align autonomy with management skill
development. Identify economic or social benefits for escalating tasks to different team
members, promoting a sense of reward among workers.

## Escalation Flow Considerations
- Time to Escalate: Determine how long it takes to escalate an issue and how many
escalations are needed before reaching the General Manager/Store Manager.
- Business Impact: Assess the cost to the business if an issue is not addressed
promptly.
- Customer Patience: Evaluate customer patience based on the value of the product
(e.g., a customer will wait longer for a $2000 canoe than for a $9 item).
- Escalation Timelines: Establish appropriate timelines between escalations based
on business needs.
- Data Utilization: Use escalation data to inform business operations and learnings
- Social Accountability: Show store staff how escalation management fosters social
accountability.
- Staff Manipulation: Be aware of potential manipulation of escalation timings by
staff.
- Employee Turnover: Consider the impact of employee turnover on the escalation
process.
- HR Initiatives: Tie HR initiatives to the complexity of team structures and the
benefits of increased complexity in associate communications.
- By following these guidelines, organizations can effectively set up their Microsoft
Teams channel architecture to enhance operational efficiency, staff accountability,
and overall performance.
