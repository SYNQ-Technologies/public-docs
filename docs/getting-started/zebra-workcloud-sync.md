# Zebra Workcloud Sync

SYNQ supports [Zebra Workcloud Sync](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/software/workcloud-solutions/workcloud-enterprise-collaboration-suite/workcloud-sync.html) as a communication platform provider.
This means that all staff-facing notifications generated by SYNQ will be delivered to configurable Workcloud Sync groups as To-Dos.

To configure SYNQ to use Zebra Workcloud Sync for your store location you need to:
1. Install the Zebra Workcloud Sync app on your devices.
2. Determine the Zebra Workcloud Sync groups that represent groups of workers that should receive notifications.
3. Configure SYNQ to be aware of your Zebra Workcloud Sync instance channels.
4. Configure SYNQ apps and devices to send their notifications to your Zebra Workcloud Sync groups.

Once configured, SYNQ Frontline Hero delivers customer requests from call buttons, QRs, and OrderUp orders to your staff as ToDos in Workcloud Sync.
