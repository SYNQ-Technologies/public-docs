# Introduction
MyStore is the administrative web application for used by store managers to configure all aspects of their SYNQ modules.

## Organizations and Locations
Within MyStore, store locations are grouped into organizations. At the organization level there are some basic settings that control branding and policies.
At the store level there are much finer grained controls that give stores the power to apply SYNQ's modules to meet their customers' needs.
