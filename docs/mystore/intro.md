# Introduction
MyStore is the administrative web application for used by store managers to configure all aspects of their SYNQ modules.

## Organizations and Locations
Within MyStore, store locations are grouped into organizations. At the organization level there are some basic settings that control branding and policies.
At the store level there are much finer grained controls that give stores the power to apply SYNQ's modules to meet their customers' needs.

### Changing Store Locations
Organization administrators have access to all store locations and are able to switch between them.

To switch store locations:
1. Sign into __MyStore__ as an Organization Administrator
2. Select the desired store from the __Acting as User At Location__ drop down list at the top of the page
3. Click __Change User__
