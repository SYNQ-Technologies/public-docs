# Introduction
Every day, more and more items are transitioned to locking showcases or display-only, causing friction to the customer journey and resulting in negative sales impacts.

Order Up enables customers to digitally request high-cube and high-value items for pickup after payment. The solution improves accessibility all while reducing shrink, improving operational efficiency, and increasing customer productivity.

## Customer Experience
1. A customer is standing next to a locked showcase and needs assistance getting a locked up product.
2. The customer sees the QR Code signage for the OrderUp system.
3. The customer scans the QR Code with their smart phone.
4. The customer sees a branded OrderUp web page that presents a showcase of products including the one(s) they are interested in.
5. The customer selects the desired product(s) and adds them to their cart.
6. The customer submits their cart.
7. The customer is able to track the progress of their order via the progress indicator on the page.
8. The customer is able to resume shopping in the store while their order gets fulfilled.
9. The customer sees on the status page that their order is nearly ready and that they can proceed to the checkout to pay at their convenience.
10. The customer goes to the checkout and shows the barcode on the status page to the associate at the till.
    - Or, the customer scans the barcode themselves at a self-checkout kiosk.
11. The customer completes the purchase.
12. The customer sees on the status page that their order is paid for and awaiting pickup.
13. The customer proceeds to the pickup location shown on the status page.
14. The customer collects their items from the pickup location.

## Associate Experience
The associate experience of an OrderUp order can vary significantly depending on how your store is configured and the various responsibilities of your different associates. The following is a simplified example.
1. The associate receives an OrderUp notification/alert on their device in Microsoft Teams.
2. The associate can see information about the OrderUp order.
3. The associate clicks the __Manage This Order__ button and is taken to the OrderUp/Picking web interface for that order.
4. The associate clicks the __Picking__ button to indicate that they will handle this request.
   - All other store associates on the same team are able to see that picking has started for this order.
5. The associate picks the required items for the order
6. The associate clicks the __1x for Customer__ button and selects an appropriate drop zone for the order. For example: __Dropped @ Customer Service__.
7. The associate clicks the __Mark Paid__ button.
   - This could also be done by a separate associate at the checkout or pickup location.
8. The associate clicks the __Mark Picked Up__ button.
   - This could also be done by a separate associate at the pickup location.

## Manager/Supervisor Experience
Ideally, managers and supervisors don't need to get involved in OrderUp orders. But sometimes it can be busy or staff just aren't responding to requests in a timely manner. It is time to escalate.
1. The supervisor receives an Escalation notification/alert on their device in Microsoft Teams indicating that an OrderUp order has gone unclaimed for a number of minutes.
2. The supervisor can see information about the order request and the how long it has been outstanding.
3. The supervisor can message individual associates or teams within Microsoft Teams to task someone to the order.
4. After an associate begins picking the order, the supervisor can see that the escalation has been resolved.
