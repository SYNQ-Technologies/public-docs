# Introduction
Traditional digital signage requires the ongoing creation of new content to match various schedules, promotional periods, and shifts in focus. SYNQ Media Manager automates this process, eliminating the need for bespoke content every week.

SYNQ customers can build templates, import them, or have us design them for a fee. Once media is added to your organizationâ€™s SYNQ platform, it becomes a valuable resource to utilize across all retail locations.
