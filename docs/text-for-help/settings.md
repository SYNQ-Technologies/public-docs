    SMS QR codes will pre-populate the customer's text messaging app with the correct phone number and keyword message. This helps avoid typing mistakes.

    Please note that each QR code is unique. You will need to repeat this step for each keyword that is used to ensure the correct QR Code is associated with the correct Keyword. Please test this prior to printing to prevent any issues.

> Need assistance? Text "HELP" to (234) 567-8900

SMS QR codes take the form `SMSTO:[PHONE_NUMBER]:[MESSAGE]` For example, `SMSTO:+12345678900:HELP`.
