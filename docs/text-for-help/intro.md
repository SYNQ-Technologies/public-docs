# Introduction
Text for Help enables customers to interact with your business via text messaging. Customers text a keyword to a phone number displayed on in-store signage. Associates receive notifications and manage requests seamlessly through Microsoft Teams.

Text for Help provides data insights, reduces wait times, promotes employee accountability, saves labour costs, improves efficiency, and enhances customer satisfaction.

## Requirements
You need a Twilio account and phone number to use Text for Help. See [Phone Number Requirements](/docs/mystore/twilio#phone-number-requirements) for requirements and configuration details.
