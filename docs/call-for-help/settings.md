## Request Expiry
If a call for help request goes unanswered for an extended period of time it is unlikely that the customer is still waiting. These requests represent a failure to help a customer. They should be archived, because they contribute to important metrics, but we want to remove them from the list of active notifications so they don't create a bunch of noise for associates. How long a call for help request can remain active is up to you.

To set the request expiry timeout:
1. Sign into __MyStore__
2. Select __Call for Help__
3. Select __Settings__
4. Scroll down to __Request Expiry__
5. Select the number of minutes to allow a call for help request to remain active.
6. Click __Save__.

## Escalations
Escalations allow managers and supervisors to receive notifications when call for help requests are not claimed in a timely manner by associates.

To enable escalations:
1. Sign into __MyStore__
2. Select __Call for Help__
3. Select __Settings__
4. Scroll down to __Escalation Notifications__
5. Check the __Send escalation notifications__ checkbox.
6. Select the number of minutes to allow a call for help request to go unclaimed before triggering an escalation.
7. Click __Save__.

## Channels
Channels determine where call for help requests are routed. 

Defaults:
- Default Call for Help Channel: The default channel for all call for help requests.
- Default Management Channel: The default channel for all call for help escalations.

Each call button or display you create can override these default channels.

## Prompts
Prompts are simple sentences that provide context to a call for help request. These prompts assist both the customer and the associate.

For call buttons, the a prompt is only a message to the associate. It provides a sentence describing what the call for help request is related to. This message appears in the Microsoft Teams channel.

For digital call buttons, where the customer interacts with a web interface, the prompts provide choices for the customer so that they can communicate what type of help they are looking for. The customer's choice appears in the Microsoft Teams channel.

A prompt can be saved to an individual store location, or it can be saved to the organization for use in all store locations.
For example, the following prompts are general and can apply to many stores.
- I would like to speak to a manager.
- I need help with a locking showcase.
- I need help finding a size.
- I would like to report a cleanliness issue.
The following prompts may be quite specific and only apply to one store location.
- Need assistance with live bait.
