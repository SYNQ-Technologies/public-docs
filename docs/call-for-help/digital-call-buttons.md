## Settings

### Staff Display Name Format
When staff claim a request the system knows who did it. By default the full name of the staff member is displayed in the notification presented to staff and the customer facing tracking page of digital call buttons. You can use the __Staff Display Name Format__ setting to limit the name shown to just the first name, or provide something generic like "An Associate".

### Custom Input
By default, digital call buttons only allow the customer to select from a set of predefined prompts. If you would like the customer to be able to provide their own request by typing it in or using their web browser's microphone, you can enable the __Allow custom input__ setting.

:::note
Customer supplied inputs are limited to 200 characters and will be rejected if they fail to pass a profanity filter.

### Mascot Image
The customer facing status page of a digital call button shows the progress of the request. This page shows a set of friendly mascots that aim to represent staff hard at work trying to service the customer request. If you don't want to see these mascot images you can disable them with the __Display mascot image on tracking page__ setting.

### Customer Facing Escalations
Customers hate waiting. But they are more willing to wait if they see that there is some urgency on the part of your staff. You can choose to expose the escalated state of a digital call button request to your customer with the __Display escalated state on tracking page__ setting.
