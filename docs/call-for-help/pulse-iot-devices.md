# Pulse IoT Devices
SYNQ's Call Buttons are just one specific application of generic and versatile underlying hardware that we call SYNQ Pulse IoT.

You can use SYNQ Pulse IoT to extend the Call for Help system to alert staff when a sensor is triggered.

:::note
Just like Call Buttons, SYNQ Pulse IoT devices must be deployed within range of a Call Button Hub.

## Example Applications
- Weight sensors (shopping baskets low)
- Infrared broken-beam sensors
- Passive infrared sensors
- Door open/close sensors
