# What's New

### Coming Soon
- Configuration of Call for Help outcomes. 
   - Each store location will be able to configure their own list of Call for Help outcomes to present to the associate. If you don't configure any outcomes, the associate will still have the option to mark a call for help as __Complete__, but they won't be prompted to select an outcome.
- Show the battery level for each call button in MyStore.
- Customer facing user interface updates for digital call buttons.

### 2024-12-05

#### Features
- Call for Help Outcomes
   - After an associate selects __On the Way__ for a Call for Help request they are prompted to record how the request was resolved. Did they find the customer? Were they able to help the customer? Did the assistance result in a positive sales outcome? These are valuable metrics. If no outcome is specified the request automatically completes after a short interval as having "no associate feedback".
- Support for BlueFletch messaging for Curbside and OrderUp.

#### Fixes
- SSD-213: Call For Help Web Admin does not show display name of call buttons.
