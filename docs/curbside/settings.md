### Curbside Delivery Escalation Time
The amount of time (in minutes) that a curbside arrival must be reviewed within. If this limit is exceeded an escalation alert is triggered.

### Curbside Queue Length Limit
To ensure staff are not flooded with an unlimited number of concurrent curbside check-ins, there is limit on how many new arrivals will be accepted at a given time. If this limit is reached, customers that attempt to check in will see a message that the curbside pickup queue is currently full and to try again in a few minutes.

### Use Locker Drop with Curbside
Enables the option to use locker drop-off as an alternative to direct curbside delivery for customer orders. See the locker guide for further information.

### Anonymize Arrival Customer Names
Masks customer names in arrival notifications to protect customer privacy.

### Show Phone Number in Teams

### Allow Non Auto-Filled Forms

Using the custom CSS panel you can define colors for your organization to customize the customer pickup form. In future versions this will be simplified.
