## Curbside Delivery Escalation Time
The amount of time (in minutes) that a curbside arrival must be reviewed within. If this limit is exceeded an escalation alert is triggered.

## Curbside Queue Length Limit
To ensure staff are not flooded with an unlimited number of concurrent curbside check-ins, there is limit on how many new arrivals will be accepted at a given time. If this limit is reached, customers that attempt to check in will see a message that the curbside pickup queue is currently full and to try again in a few minutes.
